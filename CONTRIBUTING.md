# 🤝 Contributing to SOEN

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SOEN as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soen.git
cd soen
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the setup instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file.

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add: new feature for real-time collaboration"
git commit -m "Fix: socket connection timeout issue"
git commit -m "Update: documentation for API endpoints"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers, who may request changes or provide feedback.

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/soen/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
